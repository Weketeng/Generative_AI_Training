# Generative Artificial Intelligence

Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) is a rapidly evolving field of AI that focuses on building models capable of creating new and original content by learning patterns from existing data. Unlike traditional AI systems that mainly recognize, classify, or predict based on input, generative AI systems go a step further by producing novel outputsâ€”whether text, images, audio, video, code, or even 3D simulation.

ðŸ”¹ Core Concepts

 Generative AI relies on probabilistic modeling and deep learning architectures that capture complex data distributions. Some of the most common techniques include:

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Two networks (a generator and a discriminator) compete, resulting in highly realistic synthetic data.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): Encode data into a latent space and decode it back to generate new variations.

Transformers: Large language and diffusion models (e.g., GPT, BERT, Stable Diffusion) that excel at producing contextually rich text and images.
